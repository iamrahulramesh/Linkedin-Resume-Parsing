# Linkedin-Resume-Parsing
# Extracting Information from Linkedin Resumes using pdf2image,OpenCV,Pytesseract and OCR

### Linkedin Resumes can be downloaded by going to each peoples profile and clicking download as pdf

### I downloaded some sample pdfs from random Linkedin Accounts  and converted them into images using pdf2image

### I found two methods for doing this 
### 1. Extracting information manually by defining the event listener (callback function) and selecting region of interests from image using mouse and then converting the selected portions to text 
### 2. Defining region of interest coordinates in code (since all Linkedin Resumes look the same ) and automating the entire process from pdf2image to text extraction using OCR
